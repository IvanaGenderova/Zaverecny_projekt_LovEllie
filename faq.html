            <h2>Canva Templates</h2>
            <h3>What is Canva?</h3>
            <p>Canva is an online design and editing platform where we have created editable templates in multiple formats for you to customize. Whenever you purchase an item, Canva instantly sends you a link to access your file. You can then edit the text and download your templates and get them printed if you choose.</p>

            <h2>Printing Related Questions</h2>
            <h3>How to print my files?</h3>
            <p>We do not provide any printing services; all files are provided in a way to print yourself at home or send to a professional print shop. If you’re based in the UK and are considering a professional printer, I recommend printed.com which offers a great selection of materials for low and large quantities, available in just a few days.</p>
            <p>If you’re based in the US we recommend printsoflove.com</p>

             <h3>Do the colors in your templates look the same as in the prints?</h3>
             <p>Due to the nature of Digital (RGB Colors) versus Printing (CMYK Colors), slight color variation may occur based on the calibration of your monitor. Colors can also be different depending on the type of material you print on too. We recommend doing test prints on your chosen card stock before printing in bulk.</p>
